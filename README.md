A Chip8 Emulator project done in about 2 days

It's a great project to learn more about how the cpu operates. 
It was also a great project that taught me how to read binary and hexidecimal And how to perform bitmack operations

I wrote all the instructions sets and it my fist time using cmake with Clion. I was using visual studio previously
